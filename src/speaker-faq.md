## Introduction 

Welcome to RubyConf Thailand 2023! We're thrilled to have you on board as a speaker. This guide contains all the information you'll need to ensure a smooth presentation at the event. Whether you're a first-time conference speaker or a seasoned pro, we hope this guide proves useful!

## Tickets and Identification

-  Free Ticket: As a speaker, you're entitled to a free ticket. You'll receive an email containing your ticket's QR code a few weeks before the event.
- Lanyards: Upon arriving at the conference, present your QR code to obtain your lanyard. Your 'SPEAKER' designation will be shown via a colored sticker at the bottom of the lanyard.

## Speaker Sponsors

If your company is paying your expenses to attend, we can display their logo as a "speaker sponsor" on our website. Email us on <rubyconfth@gmail.com> with your company name, logo and link to arrange this.

## Hotel

- You can find more information about the conference venue Novotel Bangkok Sukhumvit 20 on the [venue page](https://rubyconfth.com/venue/). Note there are several Bangkok hotels called "Novotel" so be sure you use the exact name!
- Except for keynote speakers, you should make your own arrangements to book your hotel on their official website or any online travel agent website. 
-   Of course you do not have to stay at the conference hotel! Bangkok has a huge number of hotels for all budgets, including many options just a few minutes walk from the conference. See more details on the [Practicalities page](https://rubyconfth.com/practicalities/)

## Exclusive Speaker Dinner
-   When: Thursday evening.
-   Details: An invitation-only affair reserved for speakers and volunteers. A wonderful opportunity to meet other speakers and break the ice before the conference.
-   Approximate Itinerary (we'll send an invitation with the final exact timings a few weeks before the conference):
    -   Meet at the Novotel Bangkok Sukhumvit 20 Hotel lobby around 5pm - so if you're arriving in Bangkok on Thursday try to arrive early enough that you have time to reach your hotel and check in first!
    -   Hop on our bus that'll take you to the Chao Phraya river.
    -   Revel in a sunset cruise, complete with drinks and dinner.
    -   Return via bus to the hotel around 9 pm.
-   Lanyard Collection: For convenience, you can collect your lanyard on Thursday, thus skipping the Friday morning rush.

## Technical Aspects

-   Tech Check: Before your talk, there'll be a short session on stage where we'll:
    -   Connect your laptop to the big screen.
    -   Ensure your presentation runs smoothly and you can view your speaker notes on your laptop screen if needed.
    -   Familiarize you with the microphone setup and check your volume.
    -   We do these tech checks in batches, for example the Friday morning speakers will do a tech check before the first talks on Friday morning, the Friday afternoon speakers will do a tech check at the end of the lunch break, etc.
-   Laptop Connectors: If your laptop has a USB-C, Thunderbolt, or HDMI output, rest assured we've got you covered with the necessary connectors. If you aren't sure, contact us.
-   Audio Needs: Should your presentation require audio, please inform us during the tech check. We have a standard headphone cable for this purpose.
-   Try to avoid too small font sizes on your slides and make sure text clearly contrasts with the background.
-   If you plan any live demos/live coding session, carefully test everything and allow some extra time in case anything goes wrong.
-   If you want to use a bluetooth "clicker", please bring your own.

## Time Keeping

-   You can check the scheduled time of your talk on the [schedule page](https://rubyconfth.com/schedule/)
-   Please help us keep the sessions on time.
-   Standard talks are 30 minutes.
-   Keynote talks are 45 minutes.
-   Timing Signs: A volunteer standing at the back of the room will alert you with "5 MINUTES LEFT", "2 MINUTES LEFT", and "STOP" signs as your time winds down. Kindly acknowledge the signs with a nod.

## On-stage Protocol

1.  As your session begins, we'll guide you to the stage.
2.  We'll ensure your laptop is connected and everything's in order.
3.  The MC will then officially introduce you, and invite the audience to applause, after which you begin your presentation.

## Video Recording

Your presentation, inclusive of both screen content and a video feed of you, will be recorded. This split-screen recording will be uploaded to our Youtube channel a few weeks after the conference: Examples from previous years here: [RubyConfTH on Youtube](https://youtube.com/@rubyconfth)

## Q&A Policy

-   We don't have live Q&A sessions after talks as they can be unpredictable in terms of timing and challenging with understanding questions and answers especially with non-native English speakers.
-   Instead, we urge attendees to engage with speakers during coffee breaks, lunch intervals, and other social events.
